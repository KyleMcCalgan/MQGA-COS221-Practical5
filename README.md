## Page Descriptions


* **Launch Page (`launch.php`)**:
    The launch page is the first page users will see before and after logging in. This page contains useful statistics accessible to all users. A button below the statistics leads users to statistics specific to stores. The header at the top of the page will be used for navigation.

* **Login Page (`login.php`)**:
    The login page allows users to enter their email and password to log in to the website. Access to certain web pages will depend on their user type.

* **Register Page (`register.php`)**:
    The register page allows new users to register an account to gain access to the website and all its features. Only regular users will make use of this page, as store admins need to be registered via the super manager management page. This extends the database.

* **Header (`header.php`)**:
    The header acts as the navigation bar for all user types.
    * Regular users will see: Home, Dashboard, Products, and Profile buttons.
    * Admins and the Super Admin will see an additional button: Control Panel.

* **Specific Store Statistics (`stores_stats.php`)**:
    All user types can access this page. It displays the average price and rating of all books in a store, for all stores in the database.

* **Dashboard Page (`dashboard.php`)**:
    This page contains featured books and the highest-rated books. Clicking on a book card will lead users to the view page for that specific product.

* **Products Page (`products.php`)**:
    Similar in design to the dashboard, but this page contains all products. These products can be sorted and filtered by name, author, rating, and/or genre. Searching for a book by its title is also possible. Clicking on a book card will lead users to the view page for that specific product.

* **View Page (`view.php`)**:
    The view page allows both admins and users to look at a specific book, all its details, and the prices at various stores. It displays prices in order from cheapest to most expensive. Users are also able to view all the ratings and reviews of a book.
    * Only users are able to give a review or rating for a book. They are limited to one review and rating per book, however, they are able to replace their existing ones.
    * This page allows users to rate and/or review products.
    * This page allows all different types of users to view a product, and display an image of the product, the list of prices at different retailers (stockists), ratings, and reviews.

* **Control Panel (`SuperMPanel.php` and related admin pages)**:
    The control panel is only visible to Admins and the Super Admin.
    * **Store Admins** have the option to navigate to their store page (`managers.php`), add a book to their store (`addProducts.php`, using `AddInfoForStore_handler.php` for existing books or `add_product_handler.php` for new books to the system), and manage books in their store (`editProducts.php`).
    * **Super Admins** have broader privileges detailed under "Edit Books" and "Management Page".

* **Edit Books Page (`editProducts.php`)**:
    Accessible by Admins and the Super Admin via the control panel. This pageâ€™s functionality changes depending on the type of admin logged in. Admins can view books not yet in their store and add them.
    * **Super Admin privileges**:
        * Deleting books from all stores (system-wide via `delete_product_handler.php`) or specific store listings (`delete_store_products_handler.php`).
        * Editing the information of all books from all stores (`updateProductAdmin_handler.php`).
    * **Store Admin privileges**:
        * Deleting books from their store (`delete_store_products_handler.php`).
        * Editing the price and the rating of books in their store (`AddInfoForStore_handler.php`).

* **Management Page (`managers.php`, `genres.php`, `viewUsers.php`)**:
    * **Super Admin**: This page allows the super manager to add and delete both stores (`addstore_handler.php`, `deletestore_handler.php`) and admins for specific stores (`addstoreadmin_handler.php`, `removeStoreAdmin_handler.php`), and see the store information of all stores (`getstores_handler.php`). They can also manage genres (add/update visibility via `add_genre_handler.php`, `update_genre_visibility_handler.php`, view via `get_genre_handler.php` on `genres.php`) and users (view/remove via `getusers_handler.php`, `removeusers_handler.php` on `viewUsers.php`). This page meets the criteria to manage stockists. This updates, extends, and deletes from the database.
    * **Store Admins**: Managers are able to view their specific store and edit its information (`updatestore_handler.php`) via their control panel options leading to `managers.php`.

* **Profile Page (`profile.php`)**:
    This page allows Admins, the Super Admin, and Users to change their personal information (`updateuserinfo_handler.php`). It also allows users to review their past reviews and ratings (`getuserreviewsratings_handler.php`) and change them (`addUserReview_handler.php`, `addUserRating_handler.php`, `removeUserReview_handler.php`). This allows users to rate and/or review products. This would update the database tables.
